	abstract = {Accurate wave run-up forecasting is essential for coastal zone management, hazard prevention, and assessment of damage potentials to coastal infrastructure. Most wave forecasting tools are based on numerical solutions of the spectral wave action balance equation that provide an estimate of the evolution of the wave spectrum but neither describe the propagation of individual waves in the surf zone nor wave run-up on land. Pragmatically, wave run-up forecasts have been utilizing empirical formulations that act as transfer functions between offshore wave conditions and run-up. Observations and modeling work around Hawaii and along the French Basque coast have shown that wave run-up processes can locally be highly variable. The response of the coastline and the subsequent local run-up is generally dominated by a combination of gravity and infra-gravity motions with the latter involving modes ranging in periods from 1 minute to nearly 30 minutes. Solutions from depth-integrated wave models - such as of non-hydrostatic and Boussinesq-type - carry the potential to offer a more accurate and complete description of the coastal wave processes including infra-gravity waves and runup/inundation over large areas and should be considered for inclusion in operational wave run-up forecasts.},

	abstract = {This study investigates the relevance of infragravity (IG) waves at Albufeira Lagoon Inlet, a shallow wave-dominated inlet located on the western coast of Portugal. A field experiment carried out in September 2010 revealed the occurrence of low-frequency oscillations (i.e., 25--300 s) in water levels and current velocities. While these fluctuations were present over the ebb-tidal delta along the whole tidal cycle, they only appeared between the beginning of the flood and up to 2 h after high tide inside the lagoon. The XBeach modeling system was applied to Albufeira Lagoon Inlet and reproduced the generation and propagation of IG waves and their blocking during the ebb. This behavior was explained by blocking due to opposing tidal currents reaching 2.5 m s21 in shallow water depths. Numerical results suggest that the breakpoint mechanism and the long bound wave shoaling mechanisms contributed significantly to the generation of IG waves in the inlet. IG waves induced fluctuations in flood currents inside the lagoon reaching temporarily 100\% of their magnitude. The fact that these fluctuations occur mostly at flood and not at ebb could promote flood dominance in the lagoon. This hypothesis will have to be verified, namely under storm wave conditions.},

We employ four different nonlinear models capable of computing the phaseresolved sea surface from the hindcast spectra, allowing us to estimate statistics for the occurrence of rogue waves. At the location and moment of the accident, the models give expected values for the kurtosis j 5 3.0119 6 0.0078. The models coincide that the maximum crest elevation was about 5--6\% larger than the expected maximum crest elevation in a Gaussian sea at the moment of the accident. We also conclude that the possible nonlinear interaction between the two crossing wave systems practically did not modify neither the kurtosis nor the largest crest elevation.},

	abstract = {The surfzone contains energetic two-dimensional horizontal eddies with length scale larger than the water depth. Yet, the dominant eddy generation mechanism is not understood. The wave-resolving model funwaveC is used to simulate surfzone eddies in four case examples, from the SandyDuck field experiment, that had alongshore uniform bathymetry. The funwaveC model is initialized with the observed bathymetry and the incident wave field in 8-m depth and reproduces the observed cross-shore structure of significant wave height and mean alongshore current. Within the surfzone, the wave-resolving funwaveC-modeled E(f, ky) spectra and the bulk (frequency and ky integrated) rotational velocities are consistent with the observations below the sea--swell band (,0.05 Hz), demonstrating that the model can be used to diagnose surfzone eddy generation mechanisms. In the mean-squared perturbation vorticity budget, the breaking wave vorticity forcing term is orders of magnitude larger than the shear instability generation term. Thus, surfzone eddies (vorticity) generally are not generated through a shear instability, with possible exceptions for very narrow banded in frequency and direction and highly obliquely large incident waves. The alongshore wavenumber spectra of breaking wave vorticity forcing is broad with the majority (.80\%) of vorticity forcing occurring at short alongshore scales ,20 m. However, the alongshore wavenumber spectra of vorticity is red, which may be due to a 2D turbulence inverse energy cascade bringing energy to longer wavelengths or may result from an amplified vorticity response to direct forcing at smaller ky.},

	abstract = {The contribution of tidal forcing to alongshore circulation inside the surfzone is investigated at a 7 km long sandy beach adjacent to a large tidal inlet. Ocean Beach in San Francisco, CA (USA) is onshore of a \$ 150 km2 ebb-tidal delta and directly south of the Golden Gate, the sole entrance to San Francisco Bay. Using a coupled flow-wave numerical model, we find that the tides modulate, and in some cases can reverse the direction of, surfzone alongshore flows through two separate mechanisms. First, tidal flow through the inlet results in a barotropic tidal pressure gradient that, when integrated across the surfzone, represents an important contribution to the surfzone alongshore force balance. Even during energetic wave conditions, the tidal pressure gradient can account for more than 30\% of the total alongshore pressure gradient (wave and tidal components) and up to 55\% during small waves. The wave driven component of the alongshore pressure gradient results from alongshore wave height and corresponding setup gradients induced by refraction over the ebb-tidal delta. Second, wave refraction patterns over the inner shelf are tidally modulated as a result of both tidal water depth changes and strong tidal flows ( \$ 1 m/s), with the effect from currents being larger. These tidally induced changes in wave refraction result in corresponding variability of the alongshore radiation stress and pressure gradients within the surfzone. Our results indicate that tidal contributions to the surfzone force balance can be significant and important in determining the direction and magnitude of alongshore flow.},

	abstract = {The relative importance of radiation stress gradients and alongshore pressure gradients to surfzone dynamics is investigated using observations of water levels, waves, and flows measured onshore of a large ebbtidal delta. Incident wave heights measured along the {\textasciitilde} 11-m depth contour varied about 10\% over a 1.2km alongshore transect, resulting in alongshore wave setup differences on the order of 10 cm over the 600-m extent of the surfzone instrument array in 1.5-m depth. Despite the moderate alongshore variability in wave heights, the southerly alongshore pressure gradient, associated with the alongshore variability of wave-driven set-up, was typically twice as large as the northerly radiation stress gradient forcing, consistent with the observed southerly currents during the week-long experiment. The magnitude of the alongshore forcing and resulting alongshore velocity is reproduced by the two-dimensional depth-averaged numerical model of Shi et al. (JGR-Oceans, 2011). These observations, together with the numerical results, indicate that moderate alongshore wave height gradients (O(10−4)) outside the surfzone owing to alongshore variations in the offshore bathymetry can result in alongshore pressure gradients that are larger than radiation stress gradients.},

	abstract = {Rocky reef coastlines typically feature highly variable and often abrupt cross-shore and alongshore changes in bathymetry. The effects of this irregular rocky bathymetry on the dynamics of infragravity waves are largely unknown. Most models of infragravity wave dynamics have been developed and validated on smooth alongshore-uniform bathymetries, which may break down over these highly variable bathymetries. A 2 week field experiment was conducted on a rocky reef-fringed beach to investigate how the variable bathymetry affects the spatial and temporal variability of infragravity waves. The height of short (sea-swell) waves decreased over the shallow reef due to breaking, whereas the height of infragravity waves increased toward the shoreline. Both during a storm event (Hm0 5 2.3 m) and under moderate wave conditions (Hm0 5 1.0--1.8 m), the infragravity waves formed a persistent cross-shore standing wave pattern along the entire shoreline, despite the irregular bathymetry. In addition, the alongshore components of infragravity waves refracted by the presence of the nearshore reef were observed to propagate in opposite directions up and down the coast resulting in a local alongshore standing wave pattern. Thus, the presence of highly variable nearshore bathymetry, which commonly occurs along rocky reef coastlines, may produce both cross-shore and alongshore standing wave patterns.},

	abstract = {Peregrine (1998, 1999), in discussing the effect of local variations of wave energy dissipation as a generation mechanism for vorticity at the scale of individual waves, spurred a wave of study of vorticity dynamics and mixing processes in the wave-driven ocean. In deep water, the limited depth of penetration of breaking effects leads to the conceptual forcing of a smoke-ring resulting from the localized cross-section of impulsive forcing, as elaborated by Pizzo and Melville (2013). In shallow water, depth limitations favor the generation of a quasi-two-dimensional field of vertical vortex structures, with a resulting inverse cascade of energy to low wavenumbers and the evolution of flows such as transient rip currents (Johnson and Pattiaratchi, 2006). In this presentation, we consider vorticity-generating mechanisms ranging from the generation of patterns of vertical vorticity in 2D, depth-averaged flows, to a more detailed picture of the vorticity field evolving during a localized breaking event. Using an LES/VOF model (Derakhti and Kirby, 2014), we examine the evolution of coherent vortex structures whose initial scales are determined by the width of the breaking region, and are much larger than the locally-controlled reverse horseshoe structures seen in typical studies of along-crest uniform breaking. We study the persistence of three-dimensionality of these structures and their contribution to the development of depth-integrated vertical vorticity, but also point out the persistent presence of both components of horizontal vorticity as a result of the isolated breaking event.},

@article{lippmann_1999,
	abstract = {Data from a cross-shore array of nine collocated pressure sensors and bidirectional current meters, extending from the shoreline to approximately 4.5-m depth, are used to estimate the relative contributions of gravity waves (e.g., edge and leaky waves) and instabilities of the alongshore current (shear waves) to motions in the infragravity (frequencies nominally 0.004--0.05 Hz) band. The ratio between frequency-integrated velocity and pressure variances is shown to be approximately equal to g/h for a broad spectrum of gravity waves independent of the mode mix of edge and leaky waves. Since shear waves have velocity to pressure variance ratios k g/h, this ratio can be used to estimate the relative contributions of gravity and shear waves to the infragravity band. Outside the surf zone where the shear in the alongshore current is relatively weak, the observed velocity to pressure variance ratios are approximately equal to g/h, consistent with a gravity-dominated wave field. Inside the surf zone where alongshore currents are strongly sheared, these ratios are up to a factor of 4 larger, indicating that shear waves contribute as much as 75\% of the velocity variance in the infragravity band. Observed shearwave-dominated infragravity band motions are confined to a narrow region of strong shear on the seaward side of the alongshore current maximum, and their cross-shore structure appears to be insensitive to changes in the beach profile, qualitatively consistent with theoretical predictions by linear stability analysis.},

Second-order interactions between different frequency components in an irregular sea state produce lower and higher harmonic components at the sum and difference frequencies of the primary waves. For water of constant depth, expressions are derived from the Boussinesq equations for the magnitude of the second-order waves induced by bidirectional, bichromatic waves. These are used to investigate the effect of the direction of wave propagation on the near-resonant interactions that occur in shallow water. For waves propagating in water of variable depth, a numerical model based on a time-domain solution of the governing equations is used to the predict the spatial evolution of the directional wave spectrum. The results of the numerical model are compared to experimental results for the propagation of bidirectional, bichromatic waves and irregular, multidirectional waves on a constant slope beach.},

	abstract = {Wave focusing of energetic swell fields can result in small-scale variations associated with coherent interference that can be important for nearshore circulation and beach dynamics. However, coherent interference is difficult to measure with conventional in situ instruments and is not accounted for in operational wave models. As a result, such effects are generally ignored. In this work, we analyze X-band radar observations collected at Ocean Beach, San Francisco using a Wigner-Ville or coupled-mode spectrum, to show how long-dwell remote sensing technology allows us to identify coherent wave interference. Our analysis demonstrates that during energetic swell events, the nearshore wave field consists of two noncollinear, but coherent, swell patterns that originate from the same offshore source but are directionally separated due to refraction over the San Francisco Bar. The length scale of the associated alongshore wave height variability (200 m) is consistent with the wavenumber separation obtained from the coupled mode analysis. This confirms that the small-scale variability is primarily due to coherent interference. In addition, our analysis shows that the shoreline exhibits a strong localized response near the radar site on the 200 m scale, which suggests that coherent interference effects can affect wave-driven nearshore transport processes and localized erosion.},

	abstract = {Observations collected as part of the Cascadia Amphibious Array (Oregon-Washington coast) show that ocean surface infragravity (IG) waves (periods from 30 to 250 s) in the Pacific Ocean originate from the coastal zone. With the deepest observations at 1909 m, we identify tidal modulation and a dramatic reduction in energy as IG waves cross the shelf break. Observations are consistent with radiation from an isotropic, nearshore source, and provide quantitative verification linking oceanic IG fluctuations with nearshore motions. Our analysis demonstrates that trapping of IG waves on the shelf break strongly reduces energy radiation into ocean basins. Further, for narrow continental shelves (U.S. West Coast), energy levels past the shelf break depend only weakly on shelf geometry. Consequently, oceanic energy levels can be related to coastal sources by scaling relations predicted by geometric optics, simplifying the effort to estimate the impact of radiated IG-waves on remote sites (e.g., to estimate seismic noise levels or impact on ice shelves).},

	abstract = {Wave fields traveling through a varying medium (e.g. topography, currents), can develop well-defined focal zones and caustics, where the wave field is highly coherent and wave statistics vary rapidly. However, the presence and evolution of such coherent structures in the wave field are not resolved in a quasi-homogeneous description of the wave field (e.g. the radiative transport equation), and a more general description of the wave statistics (and its evolution) is needed. In this work we demonstrate with numerical examples that, when using a (recently developed) transport equation for the second order inhomeogeneous wave statistics that accounts for cross-variance contributions, we can resolve coherent structures in wave fields such as those typically found in focal and diffraction zones. What this shows is, that in a statistical sense, diffraction is essentially an interference phenomenon that can be readily resolved if cross-phase information in the transport equations is retained.},

A computer program written in Python was used to compute those quantities at different combinations of wave angles and periods. The setup and setdown of the mean water level are strongly dependent on the combination of periods and direction of the primary waves, as they propagate along the slope, modifying the bound infragravity wave. Mohr's circles for the radiation stress tensor showed significant changes of diameter and center at different points along the basin. The radiation stress components for the Bi-Bi waves are the sum of the stresses associated with each primary wave and a nonlinear term which results from the interference between primary waves. Disregarding these nonlinear terms may significantly affect the nearshore hydrodynamics prediction.},

By comparing runup observations to measurements in approximately 7 m of water and numerical simulations with a simplified nonlinear model, two distinct infragravity bands may be identified: an 80 s infragravity wave, produced by nonlinear shoaling of the storm swell; and a 300 s wave, trapped on the intertidal platform of the island and generating intermittent, low-frequency inundation. Our analysis shows that the 300 s waves are a key component of the extreme water levels recorded on the island.},

The random wave spectra were directionally symmetric with their central direction perpendicular to the beach, so no constant longshore current was generated. Variable wave-averaged currents were generated because of the spatially variable wave field, and sometimes formed offshore directed rip currents that appear in variable longshore locations. The rip currents are associated with a vortex pair which is generated within the surfzone and subsequently propagates offshore. Analysis of the vorticity balance show that the main vorticity input occurs within the inner surfzone. Three different beach slopes and four different wave spectra are simulated. The frequency, duration, and intensity of the transient rips depend on both the beach slope and the incident wave spectra. The results have important engineering implications for the transport of material in the nearshore zone, in particular on longshore uniform beaches.},

	abstract = {The impact of multi-decadal, large-scale deflation (76 million m3 of sediment loss) and contraction ({\textasciitilde}1 km) of a 150 km2 ebb-tidal delta on hydrodynamics and sediment transport at adjacent Ocean Beach in San Francisco, CA (USA), is examined using a coupled wave and circulation model. The model is forced with representative wave and tidal conditions using recent (2005) and historic (1956) ebb-tidal delta bathymetry data sets. Comparison of the simulations indicates that along north/south trending Ocean Beach the contraction and deflation of the ebb-tidal delta have resulted in significant differences in the flow and sediment dynamics. Between 1956 and 2005 the transverse bar (the shallow attachment point of the ebb-tidal delta to the shoreline) migrated northward {\textasciitilde}1 km toward the inlet while a persistent alongshore flow and transport divergence point migrated south by {\textasciitilde}500 m such that these features now overlap. A reduction in tidal prism and sediment supply over the last century has resulted in a net decrease in offshore tidal current-generated sediment transport at the mouth of San Francisco Bay, and a relative increase in onshore-directed wave-driven transport toward the inlet, accounting for the observed contraction of the ebb-tidal delta. Alongshore migration of the transverse bar and alongshore flow divergence have resulted in an increasing proportion of onshore migrating sediment from the ebb-tidal delta to be transported north along the beach in 2005 versus south in 1956. The northerly migrating sediment is then trapped by Pt. Lobos, a rocky headland at the northern extreme of the beach, consistent with the observed shoreline accretion in this area. Conversely, alongshore migration of the transverse bar and divergence point has decreased the sediment supply to southern Ocean Beach, consistent with the observed erosion of the shoreline in this area. This study illustrates the utility of applying a high-resolution coupled circulation-wave model for understanding coastal response to large-scale bathymetric changes over multidecadal timescales, common to many coastal systems adjacent to urbanized estuaries and watersheds worldwide.},

	abstract = {In this paper, the combined effects of refraction and nonlinearity on the evolution of ocean surface wave statistics are considered and possible implications for the likelihood of extreme waves, also known as freak or rogue waves, are examined. A frequency-angular spectrum model is derived that accounts for cubic nonlinear dynamics and weak lateral homogeneity of the medium. Through Monte Carlo simulations, the evolution of wave statistics in freely developing waves, waves over an opposing shearing current, and waves refracted over an isolated topographical feature is modeled. The simulations show that freely developing, directionally spread wave fields generally maintain near-Gaussian statistics, which was also found in earlier model studies. However, the enhanced nonlinearity caused by the refractive focusing of narrowband wave fields can result locally in strongly non-Gaussian statistics and an associated increased likelihood of extreme wave events.},

	abstract = {Refraction of swell waves in coastal waters can result in fast-scale variations of wave statistics due to wave interference. These variations cannot be resolved by wave models based on the radiative transport equation. More advanced models based on quasi-coherent theory, a generalization of the radiative transfer equation, can be coupled or nested into larger-scale models to resolve such local inhomogeneous effects. However, source terms for quasi-coherent models to account for non-conservative and nonlinear effects are not available, which hampers their operational use. In the present work we revisit the derivation of quasi-coherent theory to consistently include a source term for dissipation associated with depth-induced wave breaking. We demonstrate how general source terms can be incorporated in this class of models and compare model simulations with the new dissipation term to laboratory observations of focusing and breaking waves over a submerged shoal. The results show that a consistent derivation of source terms is essential to accurately capture coherent effects in coastal areas. Specifically, our results show that if coherent effects are ignored in the dissipation term, interference effects are strongly exaggerated. With the development of source terms for quasi-coherent models they can be effectively nested inside or otherwise coupled to larger-scale wave models to efficiently improve operational predictive capability of wave models near the coast.},

@article{smit_stochastic_2015-1,
	abstract = {Refractive focusing of swell waves can result in fast-scale variations in the wave statistics because of wave interference, which cannot be resolved by stochastic wave models based on the radiative transport equation. Quasi-coherent statistical theory does account for such statistical interferences and the associated wave inhomogeneities, but the theory has thus far been presented in a form that appears incompatible with models based on the radiative transfer equation (RTE). Moreover, the quasi-coherent theory has never been tested against field data, and it is not clear how the coherent information inherent to such models can be used for better understanding coastal wave and circulation dynamics. This study therefore revisits the derivation of quasi-coherent theory to formulate it into a radiative transport equation with a forcing term that accounts for the inhomogeneous part of the wave field. This paper shows how the model can be nested within (or otherwise used in conjunction with) quasi-homogeneous wave models based on the RTE. Through comparison to laboratory data, numerical simulations of a deterministic model, and field observations of waves propagating over a nearshore canyon head, the predictive capability of the model is validated. The authors discuss the interference patterns predicted by the model through evaluation of a complex cross-correlation function and highlight the differences with quasi-homogeneous predictions. These results show that quasi-coherent theory can extend models based on the RTE to resolve coherent interference patterns and standing wave features in coastal areas, which are believed to be important in nearshore circulation and sediment transport.},

	abstract = {The interaction of ocean waves with variable currents and topography in coastal areas can result in inhomogeneous statistics because of coherent interferences, which affect wave-driven circulation and transport processes. Stochastic wave models, invariably based on some form of the radiative transfer equation (or action balance), do not account for these effects. The present work develops and discusses a generalization of the radiative transfer equation that includes the effects of coherent interferences on wave statistics. Using multiple scales, the study approximates the transport equation for the (complete) second-order wave correlation matrix. The resulting model transports the coupled-mode spectrum (a form of the Wigner distribution) and accounts for the generation and propagation of coherent interferences in a variable medium. The authors validate the model through comparison with analytic solutions and laboratory observations, discuss the differences with the radiative transfer equation and the limitations of this approximation, and illustrate its ability to resolve coherent interference structures in wave fields such as those typically found in refractive focal zones and around obstacles.},

	abstract = {In coastal areas and on beaches, nonlinear effects in ocean waves are dominated by so-called triad interactions. These effects can result in large energy transfers across the wave spectrum and result in nonGaussian wave statistics, which is important for coastal wave propagation and wave-induced transport processes. To model these effects in a stochastic wave model based on the radiative transfer equation (RTE) requires a transport equation for three-wave correlators (the bispectrum) that is compatible with quasihomogeneous theory. Based on methods developed in optics and quantum mechanics, the authors present a general approach to derive a transport equation for higher-order correlators. The principal result of this work is a coupled set of equations consisting of the radiative transfer equation with a nonlinear forcing term and a new, generalized transport equation for bispectrum. This study discusses the implications and characteristics of the resulting equations and shows that the model contains various shallow- and deep-water asymptotes for nonlinear wave propagation as special cases.},
